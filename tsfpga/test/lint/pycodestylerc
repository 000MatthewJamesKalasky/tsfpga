# E402 = Wrong import order. Pycodestylerc does not usually allow us doing sys.path.append(...) before import.
# W503 = Line break before binary operator. This is how it should be. W504 is respected. https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/pull/502
# E722 = Do not use bare 'except'. Triggers in VUnit code.
# W504 = Line break after binary operator. Triggers in VUnit code.
